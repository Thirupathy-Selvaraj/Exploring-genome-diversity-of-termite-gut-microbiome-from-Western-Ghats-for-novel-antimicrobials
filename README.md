# Exploring-genome-diversity-of-termite-gut-microbiome-from-Western-Ghats-for-novel-antimicrobials
The dissertation was completed under the guidance of Dr J Rajendhran PhD, Assistant Professor, Department of Genetics. This study explores the genomic diversity of the gut microbiome of termites from Western Ghats that could contribute to the discovery of novel antibiotics.

PROTOCOL:
1. Isolation of termite gut microbiome;
2. Screening for antibiotic producers using ESKAPE pathogens;
3. Identification by targeted amplicon sequencing of 16S metagenome;
4. Molecular Phylogenetic Analysis with MEGA Software; and
5. Screening for antimicrobial compounds (GC-MS).
